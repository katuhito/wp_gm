== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are you only releasing a subset of shortcodes? =

Each shortcode was originally written and coupled to a much larger packaged theme. It takes time to unpackage them and present them as a standalone product.

== Screenshots ==

1. Choosing a shortcode element to add.
2. Editing the shortcode settings.
3. Selecting an icon for a shortcode element.
